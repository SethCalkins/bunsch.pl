Recently, to learn new programming techniques, I've been reading up on game development.

I thought it would be a fun experiment to try to clone an existing game, so I would be able to focus on the game engine and code, as the hard part of game design has already been done. During recent vacation, I've been playing Dots by Betaworks, which is why I chose it as a source of inspiration.

I've decided to build it in [CraftyJS](http://craftyjs.com) and Brunch as a build tool. I've also added jQuery for some basic DOM manipulation.

Here's the result, which I've named Dotz: [http://bunsch.pl/two-dots/](http://bunsch.pl/dotz/).

It is a simplified clone, so it only consists of one level in which you have to connect as many dots as possible in 20 moves. However, building it gave me a chance to solve a few interesting problems. I'll highlight some of them in the next sections. But first, a few quick observations:

* Cloning an existing game is a FANTASTIC programming exercise.
* CraftyJS is a very capable framework for fun 2D games. Extra points for seamless support of touch events.
* Brunch is great, and I've ended up building my own skeleton for easier bootstrapping of hacks: [http://github.com/marcinbunsch/hackstrap-brunch](http://github.com/marcinbunsch/hackstrap-brunch)
